            <p>
              1. Creating the game board: I was able to do this by creating 6
              rows and 7 columns and then i used css to design the individual
              cells. I also used "useState" to track the game board and made
              each cell clickable using "handleClick". Once a cell is clicked
              the board updates and places the currentPlayer emoji in the cell
              based on the index of that specific cell. after each play I also
              call the function to check for a winner.
            </p>

              2. Keeping track of each player's turn: I was able to do this by
              keeping track of each player with "useState". the Game begins with
              player 1 as the default player. When a player clicks on a cell,
              this then triggers a function that changes the player to the next
              player. EX: setCurrentPlayer(currentPlayer === PLAYER_ONE ?
              PLAYER_TWO : PLAYER_ONE);
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Diagonal wins are detected by iterating through the game board
              using nested loops for both left-to-right and right-to-left
              diagonals. For each diagonal starting point (represented by row
              and col), the code checks if four consecutive cells in the
              diagonal contain the current player's discs, triggering a win
              alert and logging the winner if found. This method covers all
              possible diagonal win scenarios in the Connect 4 game
